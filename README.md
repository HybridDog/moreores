## More Ores

More Ores for Minetest <http://minetest.net>, a free/libre infinite
world block sandbox game.

It adds three new ores: silver, tin, and mithril. The ores can be enabled independently
in the mod's settings.

Silver and mithril can be used to make various tools and weapons.

Tin cannot be used to make tools, but can be mixed with copper to produce bronze.
There is an optional setting that removes the default game's bronze recipe
(steel + copper) to make this the only way to produce bronze.

To install, just clone this repository into your "mods" directory.
